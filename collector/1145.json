Murnau's Sunrise represents the art of the wordless cinema at its zenith. Based on the Hermann Sudermann novel A Trip to Tilsit, this \"Song of Two Humans\" takes place in a colorful farming community, where people from the city regularly take their weekend holidays. Local farmer George O'Brien, happily married to Janet Gaynor, falls under the seductive spell of Margaret Livingston, a temptress from The City. He callously ignores his wife and child and strips his farm of its wealth on behalf of Livingston, but even this fails to satisfy her. One foggy evening, O'Brien meets Livingston at their usual swampland trysting place. She bewitches him with stories about the city -- its jazz, its bright lights, its erotic excitement. Thrilled at the prospect of running off with Livingston, O'Brien stops short: \"What about my wife?\" Drawing ever closer to her victim, Livingston murmurs \"Couldn't she just...drown?\" (the subtitle bearing these words then \"melts\" into nothingness). In his delirium, the husband agrees. The plan is to row Gaynor to the middle of the lake, then capsize the boat. Gaynor will drown, while O'Brien will save himself with some bulrushes that he'd previously hidden in the boat; thus, the murder will look like an accident. The next day, the brooding O'Brien begins slowly rowing his unsuspecting wife across the lake. Halfway to shore, he makes his intentions clear, but is unable to go through with it. As his wife cringes in terror, O'Brien rows to the other side of lake. Once ashore, she runs away from him in terror, as he stumbles after her, trying to apologize. Gaynor boards a streetcar bound for the city, with O'Brien climbing aboard a few seconds afterward. Upon reaching the city (a renowned set design), O'Brien continues trying to make amends to his wife. They sit disconsolately at a table in a restaurant, unable to eat the plate of cake that is set before them. Slowly, Gaynor begins overcoming her fear. The couple wander into a church, where a wedding is taking place. Breaking down in sobs, O'Brien begins repeating the wedding vows, thereby convincing Gaynor that she has nothing to fear. Together again, the couple embraces in the middle of a busy street, oblivious to the honking horns and irate motorists. Anxious to prove to each other that all is well, the husband and wife spend a delightful afternoon having their pictures taken and \"dolling up\" in a posh barber shop. They cap their unofficial second honeymoon at a joyous festival in an outsized amusement park. More in love with each other than ever before, O'Brien and Gaynor head back across the lake in the dark of night. Suddenly, a storm arises. Pulling out the bulrushes with which he'd planned to save himself, O'Brien straps them onto Janet, telling her to swim to shore. The storm passes. Washing up on shore, the unconscious O'Brien is brought home. But Gaynor is nowhere to be found, and it is assumed that she has died in the storm. Half-insane, O'Brien strikes out at Livingston, the instigator of the murder plan. Just as he is about to throttle the treacherous temptress, he is summoned home; his wife is alive! As Livingston stumbles out of the village, O'Brien and Gaynor cling tightly to one another, watching the sun rise above their now-happy home. Together with Seventh Heaven, Sunrise earned Janet Gaynor the first-ever Best Actress Academy Award, while Charles Rosher and Karl Struss walked home with the industry's first Best Photography Oscar. The film itself was also in the Oscar race, but lost out to the more financially successful Wings.", "casts": {"creators": [], "castItems": [{"person": {"name": "Janet Gaynor", "thumbnailImg": "https://resizing.flixster.com/5UTHRGP1Jl9gpmKhvTCFGfrgtq8=/80x80/v1.cDs5OTYxMjQ1O2o7MTg3OTA7MjA0ODs0NjI7NDYy", "url": "/celebrity/janet_gaynor/"}, "characters": [{"name": "The Wife"}]}, {"person": {"name": "George O'Brien", "thumbnailImg": "https://resizing.flixster.com/81zNWeHhEuwZ5PlxqIFHCu94kvE=/80x80/v1.cDs5NDMyMzk4O2o7MTg4MjI7MjA0ODs0MDI7MzAx", "url": "/celebrity/george_obrien/"}, "characters": [{"name": "The Man"}]}, {"person": {"name": "Margaret Livingston", "thumbnailImg": "https://resizing.flixster.com/PFvrg62ybNs9aKASGc1FkEe86FY=/80x80/v1.cDsxMTQwNDM4MjtqOzE4ODgzOzIwNDg7NDk2OzYzMA", "url": "/celebrity/margaret_livingston/"}, "characters": [{"name": "The Woman from the City"}]}, {"person": {"name": "Bodil Rosing", "thumbnailImg": "https://resizing.flixster.com/6GWkMu76clzoDty4IF4umnAC0Cg=/80x80/v1.cDsxMjM0NTcyMTtqOzE4Nzg4OzIwNDg7MTA5OzE0Nw", "url": "/celebrity/bodil_rosing/"}, "characters": [{"name": "Maid"}]}, {"person": {"name": "J.
